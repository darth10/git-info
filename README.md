## Guidelines

* Only fork from development branch.
* Create branches by bugs and features, not by names or anything arbitrary.
* Keep commits sane and atomic. Standarize a commit message format if possible.
* Rebase often, and especially before creating a branch.
* If you've made a mistake, `reset` what you've not pushed, and `revert` what you've pushed.
* Establish a limited network of trust.
* Use public repositories gloriously, for actual collaborative work.
* Use `.gitignore` files.
